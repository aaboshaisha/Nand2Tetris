Building the modern computer stack from first principles using [From Nand To Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/). 

These projects cover the journey of building a computer system from elementary logic gates to a functioning Central Processing Unit (CPU) capable of executing low-level programs.

**Key Highlights:**

1. **Elementary Logic Gates (Project 1):**
   - Solutions include the construction of fundamental logic gates such as And, Or, Not, and more.
   - The code showcases the understanding of Boolean logic and the foundation for building complex digital circuits.

2. **Adder Chips and Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) (Project 2):**
   - Solutions involve building a family of adder chips and culminate in the creation of an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU).
   - Demonstrates proficiency in designing and implementing components critical for arithmetic and logical operations.

3. **Registers and Memory Units, RAM Construction (Project 3):**
   - Solutions extend to building registers and memory units, eventually leading to the construction of a Random Access Memory (RAM).
   - Highlights the ability to create storage components and understand memory management concepts.

4. **Machine Language Programming (Project 4):**
   - Solutions involve learning a machine language and using it to write illustrative low-level programs.
   - Demonstrates the application of the machine language in executing fundamental operations.

5. **Central Processing Unit (CPU) and Hardware Platform (Project 5):**
   - Solutions utilize the chipset built in projects 1-3 to construct a fully functional Central Processing Unit (CPU).
   - Showcases the creation of a hardware platform capable of executing programs written in the machine language introduced in project 4.

6. **Assembler Development (Project 6):**
   - Solutions focus on developing an assembler, providing the capability to translate programs written in symbolic machine language into binary, executable code.
   - Highlights understanding of low-level programming and the ability to bridge symbolic and machine languages.
